# nvim-conf
This is my neovim configuration. It's nothing special, but it works nicely and it's pretty simple.
I hope it helps someone else to start learning neovim now.

### Why should I use neovim?
Yeah... Why? There are some goodies out there like VSCode. I was a huge Atom enjoyer, then I switched to VSCodium (I always opt for the opensource route). I decided to switch to neovim cause ... well... it's easier. Not gonna lie. I find it easier. In truth I moved to get rid of heavy Electron based editors, but then I stayed because it's easier. Once you set up your environment you have a personal tool, as fast as you want it to be, light on resources and well, a lot of pros, a couple of cons.

### But how do I learn neovim?
Step by step. Don't try to learn all the shortcuts at once. And keep an open mind: neovim is more of a keyboard leaded environment, so you will have to learn shortcuts at some point. I still use mouse/touchpad sometimes, but I have to admit that it is a distraction most of the time, and it slows the coding session. So, as I was saying, step by step. You probably know the basics already. When you need to achieve something search for it: most likely there is a command for it, and here you go, you learnt one more thing!
